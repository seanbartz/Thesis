abstract = {This talk begins with some history and basic facts about string theory and its connections with strong interactions. Comparisons of stacks of Dirichlet branes with curved backgrounds produced by them are used to motivate the AdS/CFT correspondence between superconformal gauge theory and string theory on a product of Anti-de Sitter space and a compact manifold. The ensuing duality between semi-classical spinning strings and long gauge theory operators is briefly reviewed. Strongly coupled thermal SYM theory is explored via a black hole in 5-dimensional AdS space, which leads to explicit results for its entropy and shear viscosity. A conjectured universal lower bound on the viscosity to entropy density ratio, and its possible relation to recent results from RHIC, are discussed. Finally, some available results on string duals of confining gauge theories are briefly reviewed.},

It is found that many features of AdS/QCD models can be thereby obtained without invoking prescriptions from the original AdS/CFT correspondence. Under some assumptions, all possibilities leading to simple Regge trajectories are classified and it is argued that the most phenomenologically consistent model is the one called "soft wall model" in the holographic approach, with a preference to the positive-sign dilaton background.},

In the case of two U(1) charges, one axial and one vector, the CME formally appears as a first-order transport coefficient in the vector current.

abstract = {Coupling fundamental quarks to QCD in the dual string representation corresponds to adding the open string sector. Flavors therefore should be represented by space-time filling D-branes in the dual 5d closed string background. This requires several interesting properties of D-branes in AdS. D-branes have to be able to end in thin air in order to account for massive quarks, which only live in the UV region. They must come in distinct sets, representing the chiral global symmetry, with a bifundamental field playing the role of the chiral condensate. We show that these expectations are born out in several supersymmetric examples. To analyze most of these properties it is not necessary to go beyond the probe limit in which one neglects the backreaction of the flavor D-branes.},

We obtain the coupling constants by performing both analytic and numerical calculations, and compare them with experimental data.

It is shown that the interactions relevant to these decay amplitudes have the same structure as that proposed by Fujiwara et al.

abstract = {We present a holographic dual of four-dimensional, large N\_c QCD with massless flavors. This model is constructed by placing N\_f probe D8-branes into a D4 background, where supersymmetry is completely broken. The chiral symmetry breaking in QCD is manifested as a smooth interpolation of D8 - anti-D8 pairs in the supergravity background. The meson spectrum is examined by analyzing a five-dimensional Yang-Mills theory that originates from the non-Abelian DBI action of the probe D8-brane. It is found that our model yields massless pions, which are identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated with the chiral symmetry breaking. We obtain the low-energy effective action of the pion field and show that it contains the usual kinetic term of the chiral Lagrangian and the Skyrme term. A brane configuration that defines a dynamical baryon is identified with the Skyrmion. We also derive the effective action including the lightest vector meson. Our model is closely related to that in the hidden local symmetry approach, and we obtain a Kawarabayashi-Suzuki-Riazuddin-Fayyazuddin-type relation among the couplings. Furthermore, we investigate the Chern-Simons term on the probe brane and show that it leads to the Wess-Zumino-Witten term. The mass of the $\backslash$eta' meson is also considered, and we formulate a simple derivation of the $\backslash$eta' mass term satisfying the Witten-Veneziano formula from supergravity.},

A possible cure appeared recently from superstring theory, a consistent theory of quantum gravity: if the holographic description of a quantum black hole based on the gauge/gravity duality is correct, the information is not lost and quantum mechanics remains valid. Here we test this gauge/gravity duality on a computer at the level of quantum gravity for the first time. The black hole mass obtained by Monte Carlo simulation of the dual gauge theory reproduces precisely the quantum gravity effects in an evaporating black hole. This result opens up totally new perspectives towards quantum gravity since one can simulate quantum black holes through dual gauge theories.},

abstract = {We argue that in generic AdS/QCD models (confining gauge theories dual to string theory on a weakly-curved background), the couplings g\_\{rho HH\} of any rho meson to any hadron H are quasi-universal, lying within a narrow band near m(rho)\^{}2/f(rho). The argument relies upon the fact that the rho is the lowest-lying state created by a conserved current, and the detailed form of the integrals which determine the couplings in AdS/QCD. Quasi-universality holds even when rho-dominance is violated. The argument fails for all other hadrons, except the lowest-lying spin-two hadron created by the energy-momentum tensor. Explicit examples are discussed.},

abstract = {We study deep inelastic scattering in gauge theories which have dual string descriptions. As a function of \$gN\$ we find a transition. For small \$gN\$, the dominant operators in the OPE are the usual ones, of approximate twist two, corresponding to scattering from weakly interacting partons. For large \$gN\$, double-trace operators dominate, corresponding to scattering from entire hadrons (either the original `valence' hadron or part of a hadron cloud.) At large \$gN\$ we calculate the structure functions. As a function of Bjorken \$x\$ there are three regimes: \$x\$ of order one, where the scattering produces only supergravity states; \$x\$ small, where excited strings are produced; and, \$x\$ exponentially small, where the excited strings are comparable in size to the AdS space. The last regime requires in principle a full string calculation in curved spacetime, but the effect of string growth can be simply obtained from the world-sheet renormalization group.},

Simply imposing a cutoff significantly improves the fit to the masses of the tower of excited rho mesons. Formally one should match the couplings of higher dimension operators and the anomalous dimensions of fields to the QCD values at the cutoff. We explore examples of these matchings including looking at the anomalous dimensions of the qbar gamma\^{}mu q operators and including a G Tr F\^{}4 coupling.},

Furthermore we construct electroweak models with custodial symmetry, where the gauge symmetry is broken with a bulk Higgs condensate.

We present explicit results for the relevant renormalization group functions to three loop order, accompanied with various tests of these results.

abstract = {We review the most important experimental results from the first three years of nucleus-nucleus collision studies at RHIC, with emphasis on results from the STAR experiment, and we assess their interpretation and comparison to theory. The theory-experiment comparison suggests that central Au+Au collisions at RHIC produce dense, rapidly thermalizing matter characterized by: (1) initial energy densities above the critical values predicted by lattice QCD for establishment of a Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP); (2) nearly ideal fluid flow, marked by constituent interactions of very short mean free path, established most probably at a stage preceding hadron formation; and (3) opacity to jets. Many of the observations are consistent with models incorporating QGP formation in the early collision stages, and have not found ready explanation in a hadronic framework. However, the measurements themselves do not yet establish unequivocal evidence for a transition to this new form of matter. The theoretical treatment of the collision evolution, despite impressive successes, invokes a suite of distinct models, degrees of freedom and assumptions of as yet unknown quantitative consequence. We pose a set of important open questions, and suggest additional measurements, at least some of which should be addressed in order to establish a compelling basis to conclude definitively that thermalized, deconfined quark-gluon matter has been produced at RHIC.},

Three different phases are identified, a high temperature phase of massless partons, an intermediate quasi-conformal phase and a low temperature confining phase. The limit of a theory with infrared fixed point, in which the coupling does not run to infinity, is also studied. The transitions between the phases are of first order or continuous, depending on the parameters of the beta function. The results presented follow from gauge/gravity duality; no specific boundary theory is assumed, only its beta function.},

The charged pion form factor (F\_pi) was extracted from the data by comparing the separated longitudinal pion electroproduction cross section to a Regge model prediction in which F\_pi is a free parameter. The results indicate that the pion form factor deviates from the charge-radius constrained monopole form at these values of Q2 by one sigma, but is still far from its perturbative Quantum Chromo-Dynamics prediction.},

We introduce wave functions conjugate to solutions of the 5D equation of motion and develop a formalism based on these wave functions, which are very similar to those of a quantum-mechanical oscillator. For the lowest bound state (rho-meson), we show that, in this model, the basic elastic form factor exhibits the perfect vector meson dominance, i.e., it is given by the rho-pole contribution alone. The electric radius of the rho-meson is calculated, <r\^{}2\_rho>\_C = 0.655 fm\^{}2, which is larger than in case of the hard-wall cutoff. The squared radii of higher excited states are found to increase logarithmically rather than linearly with the radial excitation number. We calculate the coupling constant f\_rho and find that the experimental value is closer to that calculated in the hard-wall model.},

abstract = {By solving the Einstein equations of the graviton coupling with a real scalar dilaton field, we establish a general framework to self-consistently solve the geometric background with black-hole for any given phenomenological holographic models. In this framwork, we solve the black-hole background, the corresponding dilaon field and the dilaton potential for the deformed AdS\$\_5\$ model with a positive/negative quadratic correction. We systematically investigate the thermodynamical properties of the deformed AdS\$\_5\$ model with a positive and negative quadratic correction, respectively, and compare with lattice QCD on the results of the equation of state, the heavy quark potential, the Polyakov loop and the spatial Wilson loop. We find that the bulk thermodynamical properties are not sensitive to the sign of the quadratic correction, and the results of both deformed holographic QCD models agree well with lattice QCD result for pure SU(3) gauge theory. However, the results from loop operators favor a positive quadratic correction, which agree well with lattice QCD result. Especially, the result from the Polyakov loop excludes the model with a negative quadratic correction in the warp factor of \$\{\backslash rm AdS\}\_5\$.},

abstract = {We study scalar glueballs and scalar mesons at \$T \backslash neq 0\$ in the soft wall holographic QCD model. We find that, using the Anti-de Sitter-Black Hole metric for all values of the temperature, the masses of the hadronic states decrease and the widths become broader when T increases, and there are temperatures for which the states disappear from the scalar glueball and scalar meson spectral functions. However, the values of the temperatures in correspondence of which such phenomena occur are low, of the order of 40-60 MeV. A consistent holographic description of in-medium effects on hadron properties should include the Hawking-Page transition, which separates the phase with the Anti-de Sitter metric at small temperatures from the phase with Anti-de Sitter-Black Hole metric at high temperatures.},

Strong couplings of scalar states to pairs of light pseudoscalar mesons turn out to be small, at odds with experiment and QCD estimates: this discrepancy is related to the description of chiral symmetry breaking in this holographic model.},

abstract = {The asymptotically-logarithmically-AdS black-hole solutions of 5D dilaton gravity with a monotonic dilaton potential are analyzed in detail. Such theories are holographically very close to pure Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. The existence and uniqueness of black-hole solutions is shown. It is also shown that a Hawking-Page transition exists at finite temperature if and only if the potential corresponds to a confining theory. The physics of the transition matches in detail with that of deconfinement of the Yang-Mills theory. The high-temperature phase asymptotes to a free gluon gas at high temperature matching the expected behavior from asymptotic freedom. The thermal gluon condensate is calculated and shown to be crucial for the existence of a non-trivial deconfining transition. The condensate of the topological charge is shown to vanish in the deconfined phase.},

We compute, within supergravity, the resulting Hawking-Page phase transition which in this model can be interpreted as a deconfining transition in which the vev for the operator Tr F\^{}2 dissolves. In the presence of quarks the model also displays a simultaneous chiral symmetry restoring transition with the Goldstone mode and other quark bound states dissolving into the thermal bath.},

This asymmetry measures the difference between the spatial and the temporal components of the <A\^{}2> condensate. Lattice computations have shown very interesting phenomena. The asymmetry shows a jump at the deconfinement phase transition, beyond which it approaches its perturbative value. At temperatures lower than the critical temperature, it shows an exponential behavior with in the exponent a mass smaller than the lowest glueball mass. In this talk we present research done on this asymmetry, using a generalization of analytical methods developed to study <A\^{}2>. The purpose is to shed more insight on the findings of Chernodub and Ilgenfritz.},

abstract = {It is widely recognized that the AdS/CFT correspondence is a useful tool to study strongly coupled field theories. On the other hand, Randall-Sundrum (RS) braneworld models have been actively discussed as a novel cosmological framework. Interestingly, the geometrical set up of braneworlds is quite similar to that in the AdS/CFT correspondence. Hence, it is legitimate to seek a precise relation between these two different frameworks. In this lecture, I will explain how the AdS/CFT correspondence is related to the RS braneworld models. There are two different versions of RS braneworlds, namely, the single-brane model and the two-brane model. In the case of the single-brane model, we reveal the relation between the geometrical and the AdS/CFT correspondence approach using the gradient expansion method. It turns out that the high energy and the Weyl term corrections found in the geometrical approach correspond to the CFT matter correction found in the AdS/CFT correspondence approach. In the case of two-brane system, we also show that the AdS/CFT correspondence plays an important role in the sense that the low energy effective field theory can be described by the conformally coupled scalar-tensor theory where the radion plays the role of the scalar field. We also discuss dilatonic braneworld models from the point of view of the AdS/CFT correspondence.},

abstract = {We consider the particle spectrum and event shapes in large N gauge theories in different regimes of the short-distance 't Hooft coupling, lambda. The mesons in the small lambda limit should have a Regge spectrum in order to agree with perturbation theory, while generically the large lambda theories with gravity duals produce spectra reminiscent of KK modes. We argue that these KK-like states are qualitatively different from QCD modes: they are deeply bound states which are sensitive to short distance interactions rather than the flux tube-like states expected in asymptotically free, confining gauge theories. In addition, we also find that the characteristic event shapes for the large lambda theories with gravity duals are close to spherical, very different from QCD-like (small lambda, small N) and Nambu-Goto-like (small lambda, large N) theories which have jets. This observation is in agreement with the conjecture of Strassler on event shapes in large 't Hooft coupling theories, which was recently proved by Hofman and Maldacena for the conformal case. This conclusion does not change even when considering soft-wall backgrounds in the gravity dual. The picture that emerges is the following: theories with small and large lambda are qualitatively different, while theories with small and large N are qualitatively similar. Thus it seems that it is the relative smallness of the 't Hooft coupling in QCD that prevents a reliable AdS/QCD correspondence from emerging, and that reproducing characteristic QCD-like behavior will require genuine stringy dynamics to be incorporated into any putative dual theory.},

As a result, we calculate the anomalous form factor of the pion and predict its Q\^{}2-slope for the kinematics when one of the photons is almost on-shell. We also observe that the anomalous form factor with one real and one virtual photon is given by the same analytic expression as the electromagnetic form factor of a charged pion. One of the advantages of the present model is that it does not require an infrared boundary counterterm to correctly reproduce the anomaly of QCD.},

abstract = {I propose to change the sign of the dilaton in the infrared\~{}(IR) soft-wall AdS/QCD model, in order to implement confinement. The deformed model exhibits interesting properties, especially in describing chiral symmetry breaking. The expectation value of the scalar field \$X\$, which determines the quark mass and condensate, approaches a constant in the IR limit, rather than blows up in the original model. In contrast to the estimate in Ref. $\backslash$cite\{Shifman:2007xn\}, this kind of solution will not lead to chiral symmetry restoration for highly-excited states, due to the property of the harmonic-oscillator equation. Instead, it will guarantee the Regge behavior of the axial meson spectrum, and also the pseudoscalar mesons. The value of the condensate can be fixed by requiring that the pion be massless in the chiral limit, but only under some approximation in the present model. We also find that, by relaxing the IR boundary conditions, the unphysical massless state in the vector channel can be eliminated.},

abstract = {The subject of relativistic hydrodynamics is explored using the tools of gauge/gravity duality. A brief literature review of AdS/CFT and gauge/gravity duality is presented first. This is followed by a pedagogical introduction to the use of these methods in determining hydrodynamic dispersion relations, \$w(q)\$, of perturbations in a strongly coupled fluid. Shear and sound mode perturbations are examined in a special class of gravity duals: those where the matter supporting the metric is scalar in nature. Analytical solutions (to order \$q\^{}4\$ and \$q\^{}3\$ respectively) for the shear and sound mode dispersion relations are presented for a subset of these backgrounds. The work presented here is based on previous publications by the same author, though some previously unpublished results are also included. In particular, the subleading term in the shear mode dispersion relation is analyzed using the AdS/CFT correspondence without any reference to the black hole membrane paradigm.},

Modeling the colliding heavy ions by shock waves on the gravity side, we observe that at early times after the collision there are long-range rapidity correlations present in the two-point functions for the glueball and the energy-momentum tensor operators. We estimate rapidity correlations at later times by assuming that the evolution of the system is governed by ideal Bjorken hydrodynamics, and find that glueball correlations in this state are suppressed at large rapidity intervals, suggesting that late-time medium dynamics can not "wash out" the long-range rapidity correlations that were formed at early times. These results may provide an insight on the nature of the "ridge" correlations observed in heavy ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC, and in proton-proton collisions at LHC.},

We then take the output of the reconstruction as the "initial" condition to evolve the system back in time by solving the 1+1 ideal hydrodynamic equations analytically, using the method of Khalatnikov and Landau. We find an approximate Bjorken-like plateau in the energy density vs rapidity profile at the early times, which shrinks with time as the boundary shocks propagate inward. In Bjorken frame, the fluid velocity is close to zero within the plateau, as in the Bjorken solution, but increases outside the plateau. The results carry implications for fully numerical hydrodynamic simulations as well as models of heavy-ion collisions based on gauge-gravity duality.},

A part of the higher alpha' corrections are resummed into a dilaton potential. The potential is shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with the exact beta-function of QCD, and its knowledge determines the full structure of the vacuum solution. The geometry near the UV boundary is that of AdS\_5 with logarithmic corrections reflecting the asymptotic freedom of QCD. We find that all relevant confining backgrounds have an IR singularity of the "good" kind that allows unambiguous spectrum computations. Near the singularity the 't Hooft coupling is driven to infinity. Asymptotically linear glueball masses can also be achieved.

For example, at the tree-level, we find \$M\_\backslash rho \backslash simeq \backslash sqrt\{3\} g\_\{\backslash rho\backslash pi\backslash pi\} F\_\backslash pi\$, \$F\_\backslash rho\backslash simeq \backslash sqrt\{3\} F\_\backslash pi\$ and BR(\$a\_1\backslash to \backslash pi\backslash gamma)=0\$.},

In particular, we compute the flavor fields' contribution to the stress-energy tensor. We find infrared divergences in the stress-energy tensor, arising from the flavor fields' constant rate of energy and momentum loss. We regulate these divergences and extract the energy and momentum loss rates from the divergent terms. We also check our result in various limits in which the divergences are absent. The supergravity dual is a system of D7-branes, with a particular configuration of worldvolume fields, probing an AdS-Schwarzschild background. The supergravity calculation amounts to computing the stress-energy tensor of the D7-branes.},

At the UV boundary, the dilaton field is dual to the dimension-4 gluon operator, and the scalar field is dual to the dimension-3 quark-antiquark operator. The metric structure at IR is automatically deformed by the nonperturbative gluon condensation and chiral condensation in the vacuum. The produced scalar glueball spectra in the graviton-dilaton framework agree well with lattice data, and the light-flavor meson spectra generated in the graviton-dilaton-scalar framework are in well agreement with experimental data. Both the chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement are realized in this dynamical holographic QCD model.

The fundamental conformal symmetry of the classical QCD Lagrangian in the limit of massless quarks is encoded in the resulting effective theory. The mass scale for confinement emerges from the isomorphism between the conformal group and SO(2,1). This scale appears in the light-front Hamiltonian by mapping to the evolution operator in the formalism of de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan, which retains the conformal invariance of the action. Remarkably, the specific form of the confinement interaction and the corresponding modification of AdS space are uniquely determined in this procedure.},

abstract = {Recently, it has been proposed by Maldacena that large \$N\$ limits of certain conformal field theories in \$d\$ dimensions can be described in terms of supergravity (and string theory) on the product of \$d+1\$-dimensional \$AdS\$ space with a compact manifold. Here we elaborate on this idea and propose a precise correspondence between conformal field theory observables and those of supergravity: correlation functions in conformal field theory are given by the dependence of the supergravity action on the asymptotic behavior at infinity. In particular, dimensions of operators in conformal field theory are given by masses of particles in supergravity. As quantitative confirmation of this correspondence, we note that the Kaluza-Klein modes of Type IIB supergravity on \$AdS\_5\backslash times \{\backslash bf S\}\^{}5\$ match with the chiral operators of \$\backslash N=4\$ super Yang-Mills theory in four dimensions. With some further assumptions, one can deduce a Hamiltonian version of the correspondence and show that the \$\backslash N=4\$ theory has a large \$N\$ phase transition related to the thermodynamics of \$AdS\$ black holes.},

Correlation functions of operators in the gauge theory are related to the dependence of the supergravity action on the boundary conditions. From the quadratic terms in supergravity we read off the anomalous dimensions. For operators that couple to massless string states it has been established through absorption calculations that the anomalous dimensions vanish, and we rederive this result. The operators that couple to massive string states at level \$n\$ acquire anomalous dimensions that grow as \$2\backslash left (n g\_\{YM\} \backslash sqrt \{2 N\} )\^{}\{1/2\}\$ for large `t Hooft coupling.

abstract = {We extend the predictive soft-wall AdS/QCD model to a thermodynamic model by considering the black hole metric. A modified bulk vacuum expectation value and a modified coefficient for the quartic term in the bulk scalar potential are introduced to obtain a smooth dilaton solution for computing the spectral functions of the vector and axial-vector mesons. It is demonstrated that the peaks appearing in the spectral functions characterize the thermal mass spectra of vector and axial-vector mesons, where the location of the peak moves to a lower value and the width of the peak becomes wider when increasing the temperature. We observe that the peak disappears completely at the critical temperature around \$T\_c=200\$ MeV, which implies the deconfinement of quark and the restoration of chiral symmetry breaking. A numerical study by fitting the spectral function in terms of the Breit-Wigner form has been made to show how the peak dissolves quantitatively when the temperature is increased to the critical point.},

abstract = {Recently a holographic model of hadrons motivated by AdS/CFT has been proposed to fit the low energy data of mesons. We point out that the infrared physics can be developed in a more systematic manner by exploiting backreaction of the nonperturbative condensates. We show that these condensates can naturally provide the IR cutoff corresponding to confinement, thus removing some of the ambiguities from the original formulation of the model. We also show how asymptotic freedom can be incorporated into the theory, and the substantial effect it has on the glueball spectrum and gluon condensate of the theory. A simple reinterpretation of the holographic scale results in a non-perturbative running for alpha\_s which remains finite for all energies. We also find the leading effects of adding the higher condensate into the theory. The difficulties for such models to reproduce the proper Regge physics lead us to speculate about extensions of our model incorporating tachyon condensation.},

Efforts to derive these background fields from a scalar potential have so far been unsuccessful in satisfying the UV boundary conditions set by the AdS/CFT dictionary while reproducing the IR behavior needed to obtain the correct chiral symmetry breaking and meson spectra. We present a three-field scalar parametrization that includes the dilaton field and the chiral and glueball condensates. This model is consistent with linear trajectories for the meson spectra and the correct mass-splitting between the vector and axial-vector mesons. We also present the resulting meson trajectories.},

We firstly construct a quenched dynamical holographic QCD (hQCD) model in the graviton-dilaton framework for the pure gluon system, then develop a dynamical hQCD model for the two flavor system in the graviton-dilaton-scalar framework by adding light flavors on the gluodynamical background. For two forms of dilaton background field \$\backslash Phi=\backslash mu\_G\^{}2z\^{}2\$ and \$\backslash Phi=\backslash mu\_G\^{}2z\^{}2\backslash tanh(\backslash mu\_\{G\^{}2\}\^{}4z\^{}2/\backslash mu\_G\^{}2)\$, the quadratic correction to dilaton background field at infrared encodes important non-perturbative gluodynamics and naturally induces a deformed warp factor of the metric. By self-consistently solving the deformed metric induced by the dilaton background field, we find that the scalar glueball spectra in the quenched dynamical model is in very well agreement with lattice data. For two flavor system in the graviton-dilaton-scalar framework, the deformed metric is self-consistently solved by considering both the chiral condensate and nonperturbative gluodynamics in the vacuum, which are responsible for the chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement, respectively. It is found that the mixing between the chiral condensate and gluon condensate is important to produce the correct light flavor meson spectra. The pion form factor and the vector couplings are also investigated in the dynamical hQCD model. Besides, we give the criteria for the existence of linear quark potential from the metric structure, and show a negative quadratic dilaton background field is not favored in the graviton-dilaton framework.},

Higher-lying tetraquark excitations, on the other hand, become too broad to form supernumeral scalar states.},

abstract = {We discuss how a dominant tetraquark component of the lightest scalar mesons may emerge in AdS/QCD gravity duals. In particular, we show that the exceptionally strong binding required to render the tetraquark ground state lighter than the lowest-lying scalar quark-antiquark nonet can be holographically encoded into bulk-mass corrections for the tetraquark's dual mode. The latter are argued to originate from the anomalous dimension of the corresponding four-quark interpolator. To provide a concrete example, we implement this mechanism into the dilaton soft-wall dual for holographic QCD. Preventing the lowest-lying dual mode from collapsing into the AdS boundary then establishes a rather generic lower bound on the tetraquark mass (which may be overcome in the presence of additional background fields). We further demonstrate that the higher tetraquark excitations can become heavier than their quark-antiquark counterparts and are thus likely to dissolve into the multiparticle continuum.},

As a consequence, a fruitful interplay has developed between analyses of strongly-coupled non-abelian plasmas via the gauge/string duality (also referred to as the AdS/CFT correspondence) and the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions. We review some of the main insights gained from this interplay to date. To establish a common language, we start with an introduction to heavy ion phenomenology and finite-temperature QCD, and a corresponding introduction to important concepts and techniques in the gauge/string duality. These introductory sections are written for nonspecialists, with the goal of bringing readers ranging from beginning graduate students to experienced practitioners of either QCD or gauge/string duality to the point that they understand enough about both fields that they can then appreciate their interplay in all appropriate contexts. We then review the current state-of-the art in the application of the duality to the description of the dynamics of strongly coupled plasmas, with emphases that include: its thermodynamic, hydrodynamic and transport properties; the way it both modifies the dynamics of, and is perturbed by, high-energy or heavy quarks passing through it; and the physics of quarkonium mesons within it. We seek throughout to stress the lessons that can be extracted from these computations for heavy ion physics as well as to discuss future directions and open problems for the field.},

With a right parameter range, we obtain no such massless vector meson. We also find that, contrary to the soft-wall model with quadratic dilaton profile, the model allows a non-vanishing quark condensate in the chiral limit.

abstract = {Ideas and techniques known in quantum electrodynamics have been applied to the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. In an approximation which corresponds to a generalization of the Hartree-Fock fields, one can write down an integral equation defining the self-energy of an electron in an electron gas with phonon and Coulomb interaction. The form of the equation implies the existence of a particular solution which does not follow from perturbation theory, and which leads to the energy gap equation and the quasi-particle picture analogous to Bogoliubov's.The gauge invariance, to the first order in the external electromagnetic field, can be maintained in the quasi-particle picture by taking into account a certain class of corrections to the chargecurrent operator due to the phonon and Coulomb interaction. In fact, generalized forms of the Ward identity are obtained between certain vertex parts and the self-energy. The Meissner effect calculation is thus rendered strictly gauge invariant, but essentially keeping the BCS result unaltered for transverse fields.It is shown also that the integral equation for vertex parts allows homogeneous solutions which describe collective excitations of quasi-particle pairs, and the nature and effects of such collective states are discussed.},

abstract = {A soft-wall anti-de Sitter/QCD model with a modified five-dimensional metric at the infrared region is constructed to obtain a nontrivial dilaton solution, which incorporates the chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement. By taking the pion mass and decay constant as two input mass scales, the resulting predictions for the resonance states of pseudoscalar, scalar, vector and axial-vector mesons agree remarkably with the experimentally confirmed resonance states. The effects of the quartic interaction term are investigated by taking an appropriate sign and magnitude for maintaining the stability of the bulk scalar potential. It is shown that such a simply modified soft-wall anti-de Sitter/QCD model can lead to a consistent prediction for the mass spectra of resonance states in the pseudoscalar, scalar, vector and axial-vector mesons; the agreement with the experimental data is found to be better than 10\% for the excited meson states. The resulting pion form factor also agrees well with the experimental data.},

We observe that, in this limit, we can still trust the near horizon geometry for large \$N\$. The enhanced supersymmetries of the near horizon geometry correspond to the extra supersymmetry generators present in the superconformal group (as opposed to just the super-Poincare group). The 't Hooft limit of 4-d \$\{\backslash cal N\} =4\$ super-Yang-Mills at the conformal point is shown to contain strings: they are IIB strings.

abstract = {Gauge/Gravity dualities open the non-perturbative realms of strongly-coupled gauge theories to analytic treatment. Anti-de Sitter Space/Conformal Field The- ory, one way of connecting gravity dual models to gauge theories, is a correspon- dence between a ten-dimensional Type IIB superstring theory in AdS5 $\backslash$times S 5 and a N = 4 super Yang Mills theory. To describe systems that are experimentally ac- cessible, however, the formal correspondence is modified into a phenomenological duality between a five-dimensional gravity model and a strongly coupled QCD-like gauge theory. This duality is referred to as AdS/QCD. This work explores aspects of the soft-wall AdS/QCD model. The phrase 'soft wall' refers to the means of breaking the conformal symmetry and introducing a mass scale to the gauge side of the duality. We add higher-order terms to the soft-wall Lagrangian and calculate the effect on physical observables. Meson mass spectra gain a more complex structure, exhibiting a better match with the experimental values than previous models. The Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner rela- tion naturally emerges from the model. We calculate the form factor F\{$\backslash$pi\} and the coupling g\{$\backslash$rho\}\{$\backslash$pi\}\{$\backslash$pi\} as a non-trivial test on the limits of our soft-wall model. Introducing a black brane into the gravity dual metric allows us to derive thermodynamic quantities in the gauge theory. As expected at high temperatures, the entropy scales as the cube of the temperature, and the speed of sound reaches its conformal limit of one-third. Thermal condensates contribute leading-order terms, modifying the temperature, entropy, and free energy behavior. We find that the system undergoes a phase transition from hadronic matter to a strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma at a critical temperature.},

abstract = {We consider the particle spectrum and event shapes in large N gauge theories
in different regimes of the short-distance 't Hooft coupling, lambda. The
mesons in the small lambda limit should have a Regge spectrum in order to agree
with perturbation theory, while generically the large lambda theories with
gravity duals produce spectra reminiscent of KK modes. We argue that these
KK-like states are qualitatively different from QCD modes: they are deeply
bound states which are sensitive to short distance interactions rather than the
flux tube-like states expected in asymptotically free, confining gauge
theories. In addition, we also find that the characteristic event shapes for
the large lambda theories with gravity duals are close to spherical, very
different from QCD-like (small lambda, small N) and Nambu-Goto-like (small
lambda, large N) theories which have jets. This observation is in agreement
with the conjecture of Strassler on event shapes in large 't Hooft coupling
theories, which was recently proved by Hofman and Maldacena for the conformal
case. This conclusion does not change even when considering soft-wall
backgrounds in the gravity dual. The picture that emerges is the following:
theories with small and large lambda are qualitatively different, while
theories with small and large N are qualitatively similar. Thus it seems that
it is the relative smallness of the 't Hooft coupling in QCD that prevents a
reliable AdS/QCD correspondence from emerging, and that reproducing
characteristic QCD-like behavior will require genuine stringy dynamics to be
incorporated into any putative dual theory.},

model, one can generate the hierarchy of fermion masses by localising the
fermions at different locations throughout the space. However, there are two
significant differences. Firstly the possible fermion masses scale down, from
the electroweak scale, less steeply than in the RS model and secondly there now
exists a minimum fermion mass for fermions sitting towards the UV brane. With a
quadratic Higgs VEV, this minimum mass is about fifteen orders of magnitude
lower than the electroweak scale. We derive the gauge propagator and despite
the KK masses scaling as \$m\_n\^{}2\~{}n\$, it is demonstrated that the
coefficients of four fermion operators are not divergent at tree level. FCNC's
amongst kaons and leptons are considered and compared to calculations in the RS
model with equivalent levels of tuning. It is found that since the gauge
fermion couplings are slightly more universal and the SM fermions typically sit
slightly further towards the UV brane, the contributions to observables such as

reviewing the key features of our holographic model of large N QCD and

low energies. At the highest energies the theory becomes approximately scale
invariant, much like what we would expect for large N QCD although not with
asymptotic freedom. In this limit the theory has a gravity dual captured by an
almost classical supergravity description with a controlled quantum behavior,
such that by renormalizing the supergravity action, we can compute the stress
tensor of the dual gauge theory. From the stress tensor we obtain the shear
viscosity and the entropy of the medium at a temperature T, and the violation
of the bound for the viscosity to the entropy ratio is then investigated. By
considering dynamics of open strings in curved spacetime described by the
supergravity limit, we compute the drag and diffusion coefficients for a heavy
parton traversing the thermal medium. It is shown that both coefficients have a
logarithmic dependence on momentum, consistent with pQCD expectations. Finally,
we study the confinement/deconfinement mechanism for quarks by analyzing open
strings in the presence of the flavor seven branes. We find linear confinement
of quarks at low temperatures, while at high temperatures the quarkonium states
melt, a behavior consistent with the existence of a deconfined phase.},

Even though our approach is phenomenological the scalar fields resemble the dilaton and the closed string tachyon of a noncritical string theory.

abstract = {The chiral symmetry of QCD shows up in the linear Weyl--Wigner mode at short Euclidean distances or at high temperatures. On the other hand, low-lying hadronic states exhibit the nonlinear Nambu--Goldstone mode. An interesting question was raised as to whether the linear realization of the chiral symmetry is asymptotically restored for highly excited states. We address it in a number of ways. On the phenomenological side we argue that to the extent the meson Regge trajectories are observed to be linear and equidistant, the Weyl--Wigner mode is not realized. This picture is supported by quasiclassical arguments implying that the quark spin interactions in high excitations are weak, the trajectories are linear, and there is no chiral symmetry restoration. Then we use the string/gauge duality. In the top-down Sakai--Sugimoto construction the nonlinear realization of the chiral symmetry is built in. In the bottom-up AdS/QCD construction by Erlich et al., and Karch et al. the situation is more ambiguous. However, in this approach linearity and equidistance of the Regge trajectories can be naturally implemented, with the chiral symmetry in the Nambu--Goldstone mode. Asymptotic chiral symmetry restoration might be possible if a nonlinearity (convergence) of the Regge trajectories in an "intermediate window" of \$n,J\$, beyond the explored domain, takes place. This would signal the failure of the quasiclassical picture.},

abstract = {The hydrodynamic (hydro) model applied to heavy ion data from the
relativistic heavy ion collider (RHIC) in the form of single-particle spectra
and correlations seems to indicate that a dense QCD medium nearly opaque to
partons, a strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma (sQGP), is formed in
more-central Au-Au collisions, and that the sQGP may have a very small
viscosity ("perfect liquid"). Measurements of radial and elliptic flows, with
possible coalescence of "constituent quarks" to form hadrons, seem to support
the conclusion. However, other measurements provide contradictory evidence.
Unbiased angular correlations indicate that a large number of back-to-back jets
from initial-state scattered partons with energies as low as 3 GeV survive as
"minijet" hadron correlations even in central Au-Au collisions, suggesting near
transparency. Two-component analysis of single-particle hadron spectra reveals
a corresponding spectrum hard component (parton fragment distribution described
by pQCD) which can masquerade as "radial flow" in some spectrum analysis.
Reinterpretation of "elliptic flow" as a QCD scattering process resulting in
fragmentation is also possible. In this paper I review analysis methods and
results in the context of two paradigms: the conventional
hydrodynamics/hard-probes paradigm and an alternative quadrupole/minijets
paradigm. Based on re-interpretation of fiducial data I argue that
hydrodynamics may not be relevant to RHIC collisions. Collision evolution may
be dominated by parton scattering and fragmentation, albeit the fragmentation
process is strongly modified in more-central A-A collisions.},

Specific examples include the \$\{\backslash cal N\}=4\$ SYM theory, and theories on D3 branes placed on orbifolds and conifolds. We also clarify some subtleties of the AdS/CFT correspondence that arise in this analysis. In particular, we explain how scalar fields in AdS space of sufficiently negative mass-squared can be associated with CFT operators of \{$\backslash$it two\} possible dimensions. All dimensions are bounded from below by \$(d-2)/2\$; this is the unitarity bound for scalar operators in \$d\$-dimensional field theory. We further argue that the generating functional for correlators in the theory with one choice of operator dimension is a Legendre transform of the generating functional in the theory with the other choice.},

abstract = {In a theory with linear confinement, such as QCD, the masses squared m\^{}2 of mesons with high spin S or high radial excitation number n are expected, from semiclassical arguments, to grow linearly with S and n. We show that this behavior can be reproduced within a putative 5-dimensional theory holographically dual to QCD (AdS/QCD). With the assumption that such a dual theory exists and describes highly excited mesons as well, we show that asymptotically linear m\^{}2 spectrum translates into a strong constraint on the INFRARED behavior of that theory. In the simplest model which obeys such a constraint we find m\^{}2 \~{} (n+S).},

@article{sui-3flavor,
abstract = {The predictive soft-wall AdS/QCD model with a modified 5D metric at the infrared region is constructed to obtain a non-trivial dilaton solution for three flavor quarks \$u\$, \$d\$ and \$s\$. Such a model is shown to incorporate both the chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement. After considering some high-order terms including the \$U(1)\_L\backslash times U(1)\_R\$ chiral symmetry breaking term, we find that the resulting predictions for the SU(3) octet and singlet resonance states of pseudoscalar, scalar, vector and axial-vector mesons agree well with the experimentally confirmed resonance states. Contributions from the instanton effects given by the determinant term are also discussed. It is observed that the chiral symmetry breaking phenomena of \$SU(3)\_L\backslash times SU(3)\_R\$ and \$U(1)\_L\backslash times U(1)\_R\$ can be well described in this model, while the SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking effect due to quark mass difference in the source term is not enough to explain all of the current experimental data.},

@article{citeulike:797955,
abstract = {Building on recent research into five-dimensional holographic models of QCD, we extend this work by including the strange quark with an SU(3) L × SU(3) R gauge symmetry in the five-dimensional theory. In addition we deform the naive AdS metric with a single parameter, thereby breaking the conformal symmetry at low energies. The vector and axial vector sectors are studied in detail and both the masses and decay constants are calculated with the additional parameters. It is shown that with a single extra degree of freedom, exceptional agreement with experimental results can be obtained in the light quark sector while the kaon sector of the vector and axial vector octet is found to give around 10\% agreement with lattice results. We propose some simple extensions to this work to be taken up in future research.},

@article{bartz-pions,
abstract = {The Anti-de Sitter Space/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence may offer new and useful insights into the non-perturbative regime of strongly coupled gauge theories such as Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Recently a modified soft-wall AdS/QCD model incorporated independent sources for explicit and spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and linear confinement. This model contains a modified dilaton and higher-order interaction terms in the Lagrangian. Within this model we explore the radial pseudoscalar mass spectrum using two different representations of the pion field. We find the mass eigenvalues associated with each representation, show the equivalence between the two, and find good agreement with the pion masses. The Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation is naturally obtained.},
