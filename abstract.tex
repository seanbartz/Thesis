Gauge/gravity dualities are a tool that allow the analytic analysis of strongly-coupled gauge theories.
The Anti-de Sitter Space/Conformal Field Theory conjecture posits a duality between ten-dimensional string theory and a super Yang-Mills theory.
A phenomenologically-motivated modification of this correspondence is known as AdS/QCD, a duality between strongly-coupled QCD-like theories and weakly-coupled gravitational theories in an additional dimension.
QCD is not scale-invariant, so the dual theory must be modified in the conformal dimension to reflect this. 

This thesis examines ``soft-wall" models of AdS/QCD, wherein the conformal symmetry is broken by a field known as a dilaton.
The dynamics of the dilaton and other background fields are examined, and a potential for these fields is determined.
The background fields are numerically derived from this potential and used in the calculation of meson spectra, which match well to experiment.
